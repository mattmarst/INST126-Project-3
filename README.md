## Plan of Action
According to the problem statement I must analyze a user log and generate automated reports. Each log contains a date, time, activity, server and user email id. To stay organized and keep track of what elements go with what logs, I believe dictionaries will be very useful. By using a nested dictionary I can refer to each log by their index and retrieve the date, time, etc. associated with it. This will also make it easy to run loops scanning whether a person has logged in 5 or more times, if they haven't logged out, or if they logged out more than they've logged in. With this in mind all I will heave left to do is format the output which I can easily do using f-strings.
